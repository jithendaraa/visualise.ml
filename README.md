Delta Winter of Code 2019

### About DWoC

DWoC is a winter long program organised by Delta Force, the coding club of NIT Trichy. With an aim to support and improve the culture of open source software around us, this serves as a platform for young student developers (or even starters) to hone their technical skills by taking up projects of their interests. We hope this encourages collabrative experiences and allows students from all backgrounds to contribute to quality technical projects from diverse fields.

### Description

Visualise.ml consists of a set of projects which involves visualising Machine/Deep Learning algorithms in order to provide a strong intuition about the algorithm and mathematical concepts involved with the use of strong JavaScript skills and visualisation libraries. It also involves structured documentation of the mathematical concepts behind these algorithm so it serves as a 'go-to' for looking up anything regarding the rapidly expanding field of Machine Learning.
