### Description

Visualise.ml consists of a set of projects which involves visualising Machine/Deep Learning algorithms in order to provide a strong intuition about the algorithm and mathematical concepts involved with the use of strong JavaScript skills and visualisation libraries. It also involves structured documentation of the mathematical concepts behind these algorithm so it serves as a 'go-to' for looking up anything regarding the rapidly expanding field of Machine Learning.
